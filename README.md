Eye tracking for OBS
====================

Intent:

* Calibrate by looking all around your chat window
* New chat messages get highlighted in green (need browser extension)
* When you look at chat, the highlight flicks in colour to acknowledge, then fades out over 30s
* Fetches webcam directly from OBS and thus requires that you have facecam
  - If someone wants to make a vtuber version of this, the problem is that
    webcams don't share, and so we have to ask the current owner of the cam
    to give us a frame. That may or may not be possible with different software.
